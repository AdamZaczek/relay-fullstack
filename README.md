> Relay Fullstack is a Relay scaffolding application that aims to help you get up and running a project without worrying about integrating tools. It comes with many modern technologies; Relay, GraphQL, Express, ES6/ES7, JSX, Webpack, Babel, Material Design Lite, and PostCSS. Relay Fullstack is also using [Hot-reload](https://github.com/gaearon/react-transform-hmr) to real time update the screen whenever any code changes.

## Usage

Install `yo` and `generator-relay-fullstack` globally

```bash
$ npm install -g yo generator-relay-fullstack
```

Make a new directory and start the generator, it will prompt some questions to help you get up and running

```bash
$ mkdir relay-fullstack && cd $_
$ yo relay-fullstack
```

Launch your favorite web browser and go to http://localhost:3000 for Relay application or http://localhost:8000 for GraphiQL.
